Lab 1
============
We are going to use GitHub (https://github.com/) as the primary platform for in-class discussion and your project.
So today's lab is simple!
- Create an account on GitHub (it's free!)
- Tell me your account name so I can add you to the course repository (https://github.com/jayzeng/UW-PHP-course/)
- Create a public repository under your account name
- Post your repository url as a GitHub issue on (https://github.com/jayzeng/UW-PHP-course/)
